## Getting Started

### Online Version

The easiest way to start using Silex is by using the online version provided by [Silex Labs foundation](https://www.silexlabs.org). Simply visit [editor.silex.me](https://editor.silex.me) and start building your website right away.

### Desktop App (beta)

There is a desktop application that you can install on your computer which may be faster since it uses your local files and it works offline. You can download the desktop app from the [Silex desktop  repository](https://github.com/silexlabs/silex-desktop/releases/latest).

### Local or Server Installation

You can also run Silex locally or on your server using `npx`, `npm`, or `Docker`.

Check the [developer docs](https://docs.silex.me/en/dev) for configuration options and integration with your js projects.

#### Using npx

```bash
npx @silexlabs/silex
```

This command will run Silex with default config.

#### Using Docker

```bash
docker run -p 6805:6805 silexlabs/silex
```

This command will run Silex in a Docker container.

#### Using npm

First, install Silex as a dev dependency in your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @silexlabs/silex
```

Then, you need to build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

Silex is now ready to run. You can start it with the following command:
```bash
npm start
```

## Configuration

You can configure Silex using environment variables and command-line options. All available options can be found in the [developer docs](https://docs.silex.me/en/dev) as well as in the code: [`src/ts/server/cli.ts`](./src/ts/server/cli.ts).

Check the example config files - which are the same as plugins in Silex, in the [`examples/`](./examples/) folder. To test these configs, start Silex locally like this:

```sh
$ npx silex --client-config=./examples/client-config-transformers.js --server-config=`pwd`/examples/server-config-plugins.js 
```

Or like this:

```sh
$ SILEX_CLIENT_CONFIG=./examples/client-config-transformers.js SILEX_SERVER_CONFIG=`pwd`/examples/server-config-plugins.js npm run start:debug
